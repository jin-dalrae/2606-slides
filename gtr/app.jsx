          <h2>Executive summary</h2>
          <p className="report-lead">Climate Goal Platform is a product direction for making a climate startup's environmental impact a live, owned, and credible operating surface rather than an annual slide.</p>
          <p>The direction has been rescoped. The MVP narrows to climate startups and a two-sided (+/-) net impact dashboard, where net impact equals positive handprint (avoided and enabled emissions) minus negative footprint (Scope 1, 2, 3). The earlier broad framing becomes the stretch tier, reached only after the rigorous climate-first core works.</p>
          <p>The report also makes a strategic claim: climate startups are the right wedge because, for them, impact is not a side report. It is the investment thesis. The buyer already underwrites impact and already needs to explain it to others.</p>
          <aside className="report-note"><b>Primary premise</b><p>The work is not about making another dashboard pretty. It is about turning impact into something that can be measured, checked, and used operationally without collapsing the accounting logic.</p></aside>

        <section className="report-chapter" id="research-direction">
          <span className="report-number">1</span>
          <h2>The rescoped direction</h2>
          <p>The earlier Social Lab direction was a hands-on advisory and transition service: measure a startup's climate impact, build a reduction strategy, support ongoing management, and run nature-based founder workshops, with Climate Brick embedded in an AI Capital Navigator. That model is valuable, but it does not scale past one-to-one engagements.</p>
          <p>The new direction turns the repeatable core into a product, and sequences it: climate startups first, because that is where the two-sided model is non-negotiable, the integrity bar is highest, and a paying, sophisticated buyer already exists. Broad tech startups come later.</p>

          <p>The product is a weekly operating surface. A founder enters the company, the system estimates footprint and proposed handprint, integrity gates prompt for baseline and additionality, the team chooses goals, and the company publishes a share page with uncertainty intact.</p>
          <p>The report describes the implementation as a sequence: map the actual company activity, rank what matters, measure by tier, gate the positive claim, then monitor on the cadence each metric deserves.

          <p className="report-lead">Fieldwork week deliverable: five prototype sessions for a climate impact platform for startups.</p>
          <p>The team began with an eight-stage journey storyboard: discovery at demo day, referral, mobile entry, assessment, instant report, dashboard use, team access, and extended use. The prototypes were built around that journey. Assessment 1 and Assessment 2 tested two intake structures; Report 1 and Report 2 tested two result formats; the dashboard explored what continued use could look like after the instant report. Five participants completed the founder-role walkthrough, and their feedback was captured in the provided transcript.</p>

          <h2>Storyboard to prototypes</h2>
          <p className="report-lead">The storyboard came first. Each prototype artifact tested a specific moment or decision in that journey.</p>

          <h3>1. Storyboard defined the experience</h3>
          <p><code>storyboard.jpeg</code> mapped the founder journey from initial awareness through assessment, instant results, dashboard use, team access, and longer-term use. It gave the sessions a shared scenario and determined which prototype moments needed to be built.</p>

          <h3>2. Two A/B pairs tested the key transitions</h3>
          <p>The first pair tested how a founder completes the free impact assessment: Assessment 1 (A) versus Assessment 2 (B). The investment-stage paper, <code>assessment1-stage.jpeg</code>, belongs to Assessment 1 (A). The second pair tested how the result should be communicated: Report 1 (A) versus Report 2 (B).</p>

          <p className="report-lead">Each session began with the storyboard scenario, then moved through Assessment 1/2, Report 1/2, and the dashboard concept while participants thought aloud.</p>

          <h3>Who did you test with?</h3>
          <div className="report-table-scroll">
            <table className="report-table report-table-wide">

          <p>All five participants were instructed to move through the prototypes as a startup founder. Ted contributed direct founder experience; Amali, Caroline, Josh, and Brian contributed role-play feedback shaped by their own professional or design expertise.</p>

          <h3>What mistakes did you make while testing?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The test asked for sensitive documents before clearly showing the participant benefit. This confounded trust in the concept with usability of the form.</li>
            <li>Terms such as net impact, maturity, projection, and milestones required interviewer explanation. The facilitator became part of the interface.</li>
            <li>The report and dashboard used inconsistent illustrative emissions values, adding noise to a hierarchy test.</li>
            <li>Each session covered the full journey plus Assessment 1/2, Report 1/2, the dashboard, and sharing prompts. This produced breadth but limited depth on each A/B question.</li>
            <li>Only one participant was an actual startup founder. Role-play feedback and direct founder feedback should be analyzed separately.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What worked well while testing?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Internal walkthroughs caught sequencing and script problems before stakeholder sessions.</li>
            <li>Starting with the storyboard gave every participant the same founder journey before they compared individual screens.</li>
            <li>Think-aloud exposed trust, comprehension, sharing, and accessibility concerns that task completion alone would have missed.</li>
            <li>Low-fidelity artifacts kept iteration inexpensive and made it possible to compare alternative structures in the same session.</li>
            <li>Using hypothetical startup contexts exposed questions worth testing directly with founders in the next round.</li>
            <li>Repeated issues were separated from one-off requests, creating a clearer threshold for redesign.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside className="report-note"><b>Testing Process conclusion</b><p>The storyboard created a coherent founder scenario, and the two numbered A/B pairs produced comparable feedback. The main weaknesses were scope and control: too many artifacts in one session, only one actual founder, inconsistent sample values, and terminology that required facilitator explanation.</p></aside>

          <h2>What we learned</h2>
          <p className="report-lead">The sessions identified the conditions under which the concept is worth testing again. They did not validate a product or market.</p>

          <h3>What did you learn about testing?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Concept value, trust, and interface usability cannot be interpreted as separate layers when participants encounter them at the same time.</li>
            <li>Low-fidelity testing is sufficient for identifying blockers, but preference comparisons at n=5 remain directional.</li>
            <li>Cross-participant repetition is more useful than isolated enthusiasm. Repeated blockers should drive the next prototype; one-off feature requests should enter a backlog.</li>
            <li>Founder role-play can reveal usability and comprehension friction, but founder-specific behavior must be followed up with more actual founders.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What did you learn from your stakeholders?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Ted's founder perspective made the trust problem concrete: the value of the assessment must be clear before requesting a pitch deck, accounts, or other sensitive material.</li>
            <li>Amali's data perspective exposed unclear product scope, undefined dashboard terms, and the need to pair visualization with explanation.</li>
            <li>Caroline's investment perspective favored preset inputs, Assessment 2's guided flow, Report 2's visual format, and broader company research.</li>
            <li>Josh's peer-design perspective favored Assessment 1's easy review, Report 2's readability, selective sharing, and a vertical dashboard hierarchy.</li>
            <li>Brian's accessibility perspective identified required-field labeling, comprehension, form hierarchy, and trusted data-entry alternatives as baseline requirements.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What ideas were validated from testing?</h3>
          <p>The sessions directionally validated the following design decisions for the next prototype:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep the storyboard-led sequence: discover → assess → receive an instant report → return to a dashboard.</li>
            <li>Use a guided assessment with visible progress and preset choices, while preserving easy review of earlier answers.</li>
            <li>Use Report 2's infographic structure as the first layer and Report 1's explanation and methodology as the detail layer.</li>
            <li>Keep footprint and handprint separate, but define both in plain language before showing a derived net value.</li>
            <li>Make the instant report the first payoff; position the dashboard as continued use rather than the first result.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside className="report-note"><b>What we learned conclusion</b><p>The winning direction is not one untouched variant. It is a synthesis: Assessment 2's guided flow with Assessment 1's visibility and revisability, plus Report 2's visual hierarchy with Report 1's explanatory depth.</p></aside>
        </section>

        <section className="report-chapter" id="fieldwork-direction">
          <span className="report-number">4</span>
          <h2>Changes &amp; Future Direction</h2>
          <p className="report-lead">The next round should narrow the question, reduce trust risk, and test comprehension with a more representative sample.</p>

          <h3>What challenges do you still face?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The assessment interaction still needs confirmation: continuous review versus step-by-step guidance.</li>
            <li>The prototype has not tested real data entry, real files, calculation accuracy, or trust in a deployed system.</li>
            <li>Illustrative emissions values are not validated source data and should not be interpreted as product accuracy.</li>
            <li>Core terms still need to be understood without facilitator explanation.</li>
            <li>The sample is small and mixed, with only one target startup founder.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Any major changes or pivots from their feedback?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep the storyboard sequence but make the instant report—not document upload—the first visible payoff.</li>
            <li>Replace default file upload with manual aggregate fields; reserve files for an explicitly trusted path.</li>
            <li>Combine Assessment 2's step-by-step guidance with Assessment 1's visible scope and easy answer review.</li>
            <li>Combine Report 2's visual overview with Report 1's explanation, methodology, and evidence detail.</li>
            <li>Move the dashboard to follow-up use after the instant report.</li>
            <li>Use a vertical dashboard hierarchy with goals and milestones grouped near the top.</li>
            <li>Tailor intake questions to the participant's business model.</li>
            <li>Default results to private; treat public sharing as an explicit, selective action.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What are your next steps based on feedback?</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Build the hybrid interactive flow: value proposition → guided assessment with review → visual report with expandable detail.</li>
            <li>Run separate tests for terminology comprehension, document trust, and assessment navigation instead of combining every question in one session.</li>
            <li>Recruit more startup founders and compare their behavior with the founder-role feedback from this round.</li>
            <li>Test accessibility and terminology without facilitator assistance.</li>
            <li>After comprehension is stable, test real-data workflows and calculation credibility.</li>
          </ol>
          <aside className="report-note"><b>Changes &amp; Future Direction conclusion</b><p>The next prototype should be a narrower hybrid, not a larger feature set. Its job is to prove that founders understand the value, trust the data request, complete the assessment without help, and understand the visual result before the dashboard expands.</p></aside>

          <h3>Amali</h3>
          <p>Data engineer met at a networking event. Role-played a founder and contributed an external technical and data perspective.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Assessment 1/2: preferred Assessment 2, the shorter step-by-step mobile flow. Requested a clear end state on the final step.</li>
            <li>Report 1/2: recommended combining Report 2's graphs and visualization with supporting explanation from Report 1.</li>
            <li>Dashboard: milestones read as confusing. Asked what impact projection and the milestone diagram mean. Requested leaderboard and peer comparison (what other startups are doing and how they are achieving).</li>
            <li>Product scope: asked whether product is an app. Stated what the product does is not clear. Asked whether audience is climate-only, environment-related, or finance companies.</li>
            <li>Overall: stated idea is good and the project could be improved.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Caroline</h3>
          <p>Investment analyst. Role-played a founder while reviewing the concept through an investor and company-evaluation lens.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Assessment 1/2: used a startup scenario, asked whether Pre-Seed includes accelerators and incubators, and preferred preset options over typing. Preferred Assessment 2's Back/Next flow over Assessment 1's continuous layout.</li>
            <li>Documents: raised stealth-mode concern for pitch deck and accounts at early stage. Stated early-stage founders are cautious about competitors and sharing business ideas.</li>
            <li>Footprint/handprint: card purpose was unclear initially. The proxy context used transport avoidance through remote work; hardware and logistics examples did not fit the SaaS scenario.</li>
            <li>Report 1/2: preferred Report 2, the infographic variation.</li>
            <li>Dashboard: assessment layout preferred over dashboard layout. Net impact and maturity levels 1-5 required interviewer explanation.</li>
            <li>Audience: suggested interviewing bigger companies through university network; noted larger environmental footprint and reporting requirements.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Josh</h3>
          <p>CCA Interaction Design student. Role-played a founder and contributed a peer-design perspective.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Assessment 1/2: preferred Assessment 1's continuous flow if step count and time estimate were shown at the start. The continuous layout made answers easier to revisit.</li>
            <li>Report 1/2: preferred Report 2's infographic direction and found Report 1 difficult to parse.</li>
            <li>Sharing: in the founder scenario, would not share a high-emissions result publicly and considered a full LinkedIn report excessive.</li>
            <li>Dashboard: four-card horizontal layout read as messy; recommended vertical stack (overview, then goals, then milestones).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Ted</h3>
          <p>Startup founder. Participated as the only direct target-audience representative in this round.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Value proposition: asked what he gets from completing the form; stated he would stop before finishing. Uploading pitch deck stated as IP risk without clear upside.</li>
            <li>Business model auto-detect: stated system cannot infer business model from company name or URL alone.</li>
            <li>Documents: one-person/tiny teams lack data to upload; larger teams still hesitant on sensitive files.</li>
            <li>SaaS impact: stated primary cost is cloud compute and AI credits; limited levers at early stage. Suggested token-usage observability instead of generic footprint checklist.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Brian</h3>
          <p>Accessibility Lead at Superhuman. Role-played a founder while reviewing the prototype through an accessibility expert lens.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accessibility: asterisk-only required fields fail basic accessibility; use visible [Required] text.</li>
            <li>Labels: business model label unclear; recent accounts and pitch deck read as sensitive. Suggested manual numeric fields (e.g. monthly AI/cloud spend) instead of document upload.</li>
            <li>Assessment 1/2: the long form did not invite investment; suggested previewing the output after step 1.</li>
            <li>Report 1/2: Report 2 was easier to understand, but the benefit of completing the assessment remained unclear. Suggested correlating cost reduction with impact.</li>
            <li>Metrics: requested travel spend and website carbon (deploy/load impact) in addition to emissions.</li>
            <li>Dashboard: layout dense. Recommended milestones and climate goals at top; maturity and status metrics at bottom; combine goals and milestones sections.</li>
            <li>Distribution: suggested incubator or investor partnership so document sharing occurs inside trusted context.</li>
            <li>Audience: noted larger companies may yield more insight than early startups (legal reporting requirements).</li>

          <p>The MCP server (<code>worker/mcp.js</code>) is a stateless Streamable HTTP endpoint at <code>/mcp</code>. It does not require a Durable Object, a session cookie, or any per-call state. Each tool call is self-contained: a list call returns the same JSON every time, and <code>compute_snapshot</code> is a pure function of the inputs. That makes it cheap to host and safe to expose.</p>
          <p>The server is built on the raw MCP SDK (not the Agents SDK) so it runs on Workers, Node 18+, Deno, and Bun without runtime-specific imports. Founders connect their AI client to <code>https://&lt;worker&gt;/mcp</code> once; the client handles the protocol.</p>

            <li>The AI walks the founder through the inputs conversationally, using <code>list_glossary_terms</code> for any jargon the founder asks about.</li>
            <li>When the founder is happy, the AI calls <code>compute_snapshot</code> to confirm the modeled numbers, then <code>generate_report</code> for the full AI briefing.</li>
            <li>Pushing to the dashboard is a separate, explicit step: <code>create_dashboard_save_link</code> returns a one-time link the founder clicks to copy the assessment into the dashboard.</li>

The server itself forgets the call as soon as it returns.</p>
          <p>There is no anonymous-quota path for the MCP route: the AI client has its own usage model, and the assessment is generated against the founder's existing account on the underlying LLM. The Worker only bills the AI for the briefing call.</p>

The founder can trace every recommendation back to the data that produced it.</p>

          <h2>Maturity progression</h2>
          <p>Maturity is a four-level progression that mirrors the share-page's audit label. The dashboard shows the current level, the inputs that would move it up, and the date the level last changed.</p>
          <div className="report-table-scroll">
            <table className="report-table">
              <thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>What it means</th></tr></thead>
              <tbody>
                {stage2MaturityStages.map(([stage, what]) => (
                  <tr key={stage}><td>{stage}</td><td>{what}</td></tr>
                ))}
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>
          <p>The maturity level is also a share-page label. A Level 3 dashboard can carry a "measured" badge on the public share; a Level 4 can carry an "audited" badge. The badge is a derivation, not a separate input — it stays consistent with the dashboard.</p>
        </section>

        <section className="report-chapter">
          <span className="report-number">3</span>
          <h2>AI briefing as insight</h2>
          <p>The AI briefing is reused on the dashboard, not regenerated. The same grounded narrative the founder saw in the report travels with the snapshot, so the dashboard's "what does this mean?" answer is consistent with the report's. The briefing never invents a URL — it cites only from the fact pack.</p>
          <p>The briefing is persistent on the dashboard. It is not a one-time reveal; it is a surface the founder can re-read. If the underlying snapshot changes (a goal is closed, a milestone is hit), the briefing re-grounds against the new facts.</p>
        </section>

        <section className="report-chapter">
          <span className="report-number">4</span>
          <h2>Follow-up cadence</h2>
          <p>Every metric has a natural cadence. The dashboard surfaces it: a cloud-spend line is a monthly metric; a travel line is a quarterly one; a handprint claim is an annual one. Recommendations arrive at the cadence their underlying metric deserves, not on a single notification schedule.</p>
          <p>Cadence drift is the default failure mode — the same recommendation pinging weekly until the founder ignores it. The fix is to bind the cadence to the metric, not to the user, and to suppress repeat recommendations until the underlying signal changes.</p>
          <aside className="report-note report-note-yellow"><b>Why this is the last sub-page</b><p>Insights are the place where the other five connect. Onboarding A and B produce the snapshot.

          <h2>Executive summary</h2>
          <p className="report-lead">The presentation closed fieldwork week by narrating a paper-prototype study for a startup climate-impact platform — onboarding, instant report, and dashboard — tested with five founder-role participants.</p>
          <p>The team’s honest read: the concept and the link between business activity and environmental impact resonated, but the sessions asked too much at once and still failed to answer the simplest founder question — <em>why should I do this?</em> Mentor feedback reinforced that gap and suggested a cleaner A/B structure for the next round.</p>
          <aside className="report-note"><b>How to read this page</b><p>Use the detailed fieldwork report for artifact inventory, participant tables, and aggregated findings. This page preserves the spoken narrative and the critique that shaped the next iteration.</p></aside>
        </section>

        <section className="report-chapter" id="feedback-product">
          <span className="report-number">1</span>
          <h2>What we presented</h2>
          <p>Team GTR introduced a carbon planner for startups — a product direction aimed at helping founders see the planning impact of continuing to operate as they do today. The study focused on paper prototypes for three moments in the journey:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Onboarding / assessment</b> — mobile-first intake so founders could imagine using their own phone.</li>
            <li><b>Instant report</b> — deliberately letter-shaped to feel like receiving a real document, while remaining readable on desktop.</li>
            <li><b>Dashboard</b> — a surface founders would return to while running the business.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The storyboard came first: make founders aware the platform exists, open it on a smartphone, complete assessment, receive a report, then move into ongoing dashboard use. Every prototype artifact tested a specific transition in that path.</p>
        </section>

        <section className="report-chapter" id="feedback-process">
          <span className="report-number">2</span>
          <h2>Testing process</h2>
          <p>After building the paper prototypes, the team ran five sessions and synthesized feedback across distinct perspectives:</p>
          <div className="report-table-scroll">
            <table className="report-table report-table-wide">
              <thead><tr><th>Participant</th><th>Background</th><th>What they brought</th></tr></thead>
              <tbody>
                {presentationParticipants.map(([name, role, note]) => (
                  <tr key={name}><td>{name}</td><td>{role}</td><td>{note}</td></tr>
                ))}
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>
          <p>Sessions took place at the Superhuman office during a team visit and at a Monday coffee-connection event. Ted was the only actual startup founder; the other four stress-tested comprehension, investor logic, design clarity, and accessibility — which helped surface inclusive-design gaps the team might have missed with a founder-only sample.</p>
          <p>For each major step, the team showed two variations and asked which felt better: Assessment A vs B, Report A vs B, then the dashboard. Participants moved start-to-finish through the journey, but with A/B choices embedded throughout the session rather than as two fully separated tracks.</p>
        </section>

        <section className="report-chapter" id="feedback-signal">
          <span className="report-number">3</span>
          <h2>What participants valued</h2>
          <p>Despite friction in the sessions, the overall concept left a strong impression. Participants responded well to usability ideas and to the connection between environmental impact and everyday business decisions — seeing effects they had not previously considered.</p>
          <p>A/B comparisons were especially productive. When a first variation missed, a second often landed: <em>“The first one didn’t quite land, but the second one did — this is what I was imagining.”</em> That pattern gave the team clearer evidence about which intake structure, report format, and visual hierarchy deserved another pass.</p>
          <aside className="report-note report-note-yellow"><b>Signal to keep</b><p>Early paired testing worked. The next iteration should preserve comparison, but reduce cognitive load by presenting each track as a coherent whole.</p></aside>

        <section className="report-chapter" id="feedback-friction">
          <span className="report-number">4</span>
          <h2>Where the sessions broke</h2>
          <p>The team identified three self-inflicted problems in how the study was built and run:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Too much in one sitting.</b> Two assessments, two reports, and a dashboard in a single session overwhelmed participants.</li>
            <li><b>Complex prototype language.</b> Early copy was hard to follow for most role-played founders; only Ted, the actual founder, navigated it comfortably.</li>
            <li><b>Uneven session setup.</b> Not every participant entered with the same mental model of the journey until the team added an internal walkthrough before showing screens.</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="report-table-scroll">
            <table className="report-table report-table-wide">
              <thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>What we heard</th><th>Implication</th></tr></thead>
              <tbody>
                {presentationTakeaways.map(([theme, heard, implication]) => (
                  <tr key={theme}><td>{theme}</td><td>{heard}</td><td>{implication}</td></tr>
                ))}
              </tbody>

        <section className="report-chapter" id="feedback-question">
          <span className="report-number">5</span>
          <h2>The recurring question</h2>
          <p className="report-lead">Across sessions, the most consistent pushback was not a layout detail. It was purpose.</p>
          <blockquote className="report-quote">Why? What is the main purpose behind this product? Why would we want to use it?</blockquote>
          <p>Participants liked the design direction but needed a sharper value proposition before they would invest attention — let alone documents — in the flow. The onboarding journey currently asks for information before delivering meaningful value. That sequencing showed up again in the detailed fieldwork findings as upload friction and an unclear product type.</p>
          <p>If the next iteration answers <em>why</em> before <em>what to upload</em>, the same prototype structure becomes much easier to defend.</p>
        </section>

        <section className="report-chapter" id="feedback-mentor">
          <span className="report-number">6</span>
          <h2>Mentor feedback</h2>
          <h3>Climate Brick outreach</h3>
          <p>The team reached out through email, LinkedIn, and Instagram but did not receive a substantive reply beyond one positive expression of interest. Climate Brick remains a reference shelf, not a confirmed partnership.</p>
          <h3>Stay on purpose</h3>
          <p>The mentor treated the recurring <em>why</em> question as a useful gut check rather than a failure — a reminder to pause amid prototypes and pixels and restate what the product is actually trying to achieve.</p>
          <h3>Reframe A/B testing</h3>
          <p>When participants felt confused despite seeing the full journey, the mentor suspected the within-session A/B switching. Homework for the next round: group all of Track A into one complete experience and all of Track B into another, so messaging, flow, CTAs, and tone stay consistent inside each track.</p>
          <aside className="report-note"><b>Mentor verdict</b><p>The latest iteration read as the strongest version so far. The team was encouraged to carry the feedback forward into the working prototype and the next founder-recruitment pass.</p></aside>

          <p>The fact pack is the boundary the AI cannot cross. A founder who asks the briefing a question outside the fact pack gets a calibrated "I don't have evidence for that" rather than a confident invention.</p>

          <p>The library is split between <code>data/evidence.js</code> (the curated content) and <code>worker/snapshot.js</code> (the math that consumes it). The split is deliberate: the content changes when a methodology is updated; the math changes when the team size scaling rule or the foundation-model multiplier changes. Keeping them in separate files makes both reviewable.</p>
          <p>The activities database (<code>ACTIVITIES_DB</code>) lives in <code>worker/snapshot.js</code> because it is consumed by <code>computeSnapshot()</code>. Its <code>type: "modeled"</code> flag is what makes the honesty rule "modeled, never measured" enforceable: a measured input from the founder overrides the <code>defaultVal</code> in the dashboard, and the snapshot records the override.</p>

          <p>The flag is <code>isFoundationModel</code> on the assessment.

          <h2>Why the SaaS baseline fails here</h2>
          <p>The SaaS benchmark band in <code>BENCHMARKS.sectors.SaaS</code> is 1.5–4.0 tCO2e/FTE/yr. A frontier-model team with 10 staff, 8 GPUs running 24/7, 3 large training jobs per quarter, and a 200-person RLHF contractor network sits at 5,000–20,000 tCO2e/yr — three orders of magnitude above the SaaS band. Without the special case, the per-FTE baseline would underreport by ~1000x, and the founder would receive a share page that says "you're at the bottom of your peer band" when the actual footprint is large and well-known.</p>
          <p>The fix is not a better default. The fix is a separate path that admits the workload is different.</p>

          <h2>What the 25,000 tCO2e/yr workforce baseline covers</h2>
          <p>RLHF and data-annotation workforces are typically distributed (vendors across multiple countries), often working from home or shared offices. The carbon footprint of this labor is not a per-FTE employee commuting number — it is a category-1 purchased-services line for the contractor vendor plus a smaller share of the contractor's own office energy. The 25,000 tCO2e/yr figure is a flat baseline, not a per-FTE number, and is injected as a separate footprint line on the snapshot so the founder sees it and can replace it with their own measured value.</p>
          <p>The 25,000 figure is conservative for large US/EU RLHF operations and on the low end for offshore-heavy workforces. It is the same order of magnitude cited in public RLHF footprint analyses; the dashboard labels it as an indicative default and invites replacement.</p>
        </section>

        <section className="report-chapter">
          <span className="report-number">3</span>
          <h2>What it does not change</h2>
          <p>The +/- separation stays. A foundation-model founder still has to defend the handprint side with baseline, displacement, and additionality gates — the 1000x multiplier is a footprint number, not a handprint number. The integrity gates on the avoided side (avoided-grid, avoided-transport, avoided-material) are unchanged.</p>
          <p>If the founder can supply measured token spend (kWh from a hyperscaler bill, training-job GPU-hours, RLHF-vendor invoices), the snapshot uses the measured value and the 1000x multiplier falls away. The model defaults are a fallback, not a ceiling.</p>
          <aside className="report-note report-note-yellow"><b>Honest uncertainty</b><p>The foundation-model snapshot has wider uncertainty bands than a SaaS snapshot, because the input space is larger and the supplier footprint depends on data-center region, cooling, and PUE. The report labels the +/- band explicitly so the founder (and any diligence reader) sees the margin.</p></aside>

            <li><b>Report tile.</b> A labelled band (low–high) on the peer-benchmark card, with the sector name and the source URL underneath. The founder can click through to the source.</li>
            <li><b>AI briefing.</b> The narrative compares the founder's snapshot to the band and explains whether the founder is inside, below, or above. The narrative cites the band by name and the source URL.</li>
            <li><b>Share card.</b> The OG image shows the founder's grade and the band — never the raw numbers. The sector is in the alt text for accessibility.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If the founder changes the business model in the dashboard, the report is recomputed and the three surfaces update on the next save. The benchmark is a derivation, not a stored field.</p>

        <section className="report-chapter">
          <span className="report-number">3</span>
          <h2>Why the report is modular, not monolithic</h2>
          <p>A single "average startup" benchmark hides the cohort the founder cares about. The modular architecture — the sector library, the match rules, the aggregation rule — exists so the founder reads a benchmark against their actual peers, not against a category that does not describe them.</p>
          <p>The same modularity is what makes Phase F (the tailored intake) defensible. Tailoring the intake changes the snapshot; the modular report reads the snapshot against the matching sector. Two coupled systems, both keyed off the business model.</p>
          <aside className="report-note"><b>Future sectors</b><p>Adding a new sector is a single row in <code>BENCHMARKS.sectors</code> plus a keyword in the match rules. The benchmark rendering, the briefing narrative, and the share card pick it up automatically. The cost of a new sector is the cost of a good source URL — not a code change.</p></aside>

            <li>Edit reports or snapshots. A bad snapshot is deleted by the founder, not by the admin. There is no admin-side edit because the integrity gates that protect the founder would have to be relaxed for an admin to make changes.</li>
            <li>Generate share tokens. Per-snapshot visibility is set by the founder. The admin cannot generate a private link to a private report — the share-token path is session-bound to the founder's account.</li>
